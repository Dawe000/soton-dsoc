            "description": "The University of Southampton Decentralised Society, also known as dSoc, is presenting Blockchain 101 — a new series of workshops that will introduce the wonders of blockchain technology to everyone interested. The first workshop is led by George Giamouridis - PhD researcher at the Cyber Security Research Group of our university. \nThe team will give a brief talk about the history and technical aspects of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency that introduced the blockchain to the world. You will also be able to directly interact with the Bitcoin network and explore blocks, transactions and other metadata. \nThis workshop relies on working with a laptop and basic knowledge of the terminal is recommended. There will be helpers assisting with the setup and troubleshooting. \nRefresements will be provided!",
